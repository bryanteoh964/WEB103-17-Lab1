// What exactly is middleware? Please give some examples
// Middleware is a function that is executed between the request and response of an API call.
// It can be used to modify the request or response objects, or to perform some other action
// before the response is sent back to the client. Middleware is often used for authentication
// and authorization, logging, and error handling.
